# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The project focuses on practicing HTML skills, creating a simple website that includes a main index page linking to individual recipe pages.

## Project Structure

The website consists of:
- **Index Page**: Links to multiple recipes.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each page contains:
  - A title (the name of the dish)
  - An image of the dish
  - A description of the recipe
  - A list of ingredients
  - Step-by-step instructions

## Features

- Basic HTML page structure.
- Organized content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- Images for each recipe.

## Folder Structure

```
